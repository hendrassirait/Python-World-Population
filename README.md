# Python-World-Population
using django to create HTML page that shows population of the cities around the world
I use Folium to create map, Pandas to calculate population and math to define NaN data
I got the json file from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

to use it, just run python3 map.py in your terminal (shell)
it will create file called Map1.html
you can open Map1.html for result.

Thanks
